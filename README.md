Yet Another SPark Framework

An easy and lightweight tool for data engineering process built on top of Apache Spark.

## Introduction

Yasp was created to help data engineers (I am one of them) working with Apache Spark to reduce their pipeline development time by using a no-code approach.

It is written in **Scala** on top of **Apache Spark** and managed as an SBT multi module project.

## Getting Started

* checkout yasp: `git clone https://github.com/giucris/yasp.git`
* run yasp test: `sbt clean test`
* build yasp : `sbt assembly`
* all in one: `bash ci.sh`
